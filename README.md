# Hey, I'm Evan ðŸ‘‹

I'm majoring in computer science at Washington University in St. Louis and I'm expecting to graduate in spring 2025. I really enjoy back-end development and one of my primary interests is software architecture. I love learning about new architectural tools and incorporating them into projects that I'm working on. I also have an appreciation for full-stack development.

I have experience in\

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ins>Technologies</ins> **GitHub, React, Next.js, Node.js, Linux, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Swift, React Native,\
